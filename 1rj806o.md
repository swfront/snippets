> in java 8, i have a query executor class which calls a procedure whose id is dynamically picked from table based on condition. i should be able to supply a pre process hook and post process hook. the supplied processes will be varying based on need and will be implemnted by consumers of query executor. which pattern should i use.

---

You can use the Strategy pattern to implement this functionality in Java 8.

Define an interface for pre-processing and post-processing hooks that consumers can implement, and include those interfaces as fields in your query executor class.

When the query executor is called, it can check the table to determine which procedure to execute and then call the appropriate pre-processing and post-processing hooks. Consumers can implement these hooks to perform any necessary pre-processing or post-processing based on their specific needs.

> can you give a sample eimplemtnation

---

Sure, here's a sample implementation using the Strategy pattern in Java 8:

typescript

```typescript
// Define interfaces for pre-processing and post-processing hooks
interface PreProcessHook {
    void run();
}

interface PostProcessHook {
    void run();
}

// Query executor class
class QueryExecutor {
    private PreProcessHook preProcessHook;
    private PostProcessHook postProcessHook;

    public void setPreProcessHook(PreProcessHook preProcessHook) {
        this.preProcessHook = preProcessHook;
    }

    public void setPostProcessHook(PostProcessHook postProcessHook) {
        this.postProcessHook = postProcessHook;
    }

    public void executeQuery(String procedureId) {
        // Look up procedure based on ID
        // ...

        // Call pre-processing hook if defined
        if (preProcessHook != null) {
            preProcessHook.run();
        }

        // Call procedure
        // ...

        // Call post-processing hook if defined
        if (postProcessHook != null) {
            postProcessHook.run();
        }
    }
}

// Example consumer implementation of pre-processing and post-processing hooks
class ExamplePreProcessHook implements PreProcessHook {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running pre-processing hook...");
    }
}

class ExamplePostProcessHook implements PostProcessHook {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running post-processing hook...");
    }
}

// Example usage
QueryExecutor queryExecutor = new QueryExecutor();
queryExecutor.setPreProcessHook(new ExamplePreProcessHook());
queryExecutor.setPostProcessHook(new ExamplePostProcessHook());
queryExecutor.executeQuery("my-procedure-id");
```

In this example, the `QueryExecutor` class defines fields for the pre-processing and post-processing hooks, and exposes setter methods for these fields so that consumers can set their own implementations. When `executeQuery` is called, the query executor first checks if a pre-processing hook has been defined, and calls its `run` method if so. It then executes the query itself, and finally checks if a post-processing hook has been defined, and calls its `run` method if so.

In the example usage code, we create a new instance of `QueryExecutor`, set our own implementation of the pre-processing and post-processing hooks, and then call `executeQuery` with a procedure ID. When `executeQuery` is called, it will run our implementations of the pre-processing and post-processing hooks before and after executing the query.

> how to implement a functional interface where i can process to return values, like subscribe returning success and failure

---

You can define a functional interface with two methods to handle success and failure scenarios, and then use it to implement the processing logic that can return values.

Here's an example of how you could define a functional interface with success and failure methods:

java

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface ResultHandler<T> {
    void onSuccess(T result);
    void onFailure(Throwable error);
}
```

The `ResultHandler` interface is generic, so you can define the type of the result that it should handle. It defines two methods, `onSuccess` and `onFailure`, which will be called based on the success or failure of the processing logic.

Here's an example of how you could use the `ResultHandler` interface to implement processing logic that returns values:

typescript

```typescript
public void processSomething(ResultHandler<String> handler) {
    try {
        String result = // logic to process something and return a result
        handler.onSuccess(result);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        handler.onFailure(e);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `processSomething` method takes a `ResultHandler` parameter, which it will use to handle the result of the processing logic. Inside the method, it uses a `try`/`catch` block to call either the `onSuccess` method with the result value or the `onFailure` method with the thrown error, depending on the success or failure of the processing logic.

Here's an example of how you could call the `processSomething` method with a `ResultHandler`:

typescript

```typescript
processSomething(new ResultHandler<String>() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(String result) {
        System.out.println("Success: " + result);
    }

    @Override
    public void onFailure(Throwable error) {
        System.err.println("Error: " + error.getMessage());
    }
});
```

In this example, we create an anonymous implementation of the `ResultHandler` interface with `String` as the type parameter. We override the `onSuccess` method to print out the result, and the `onFailure` method to print out the error message. We then pass this implementation to the `processSomething` method to handle the result of the processing logic.
