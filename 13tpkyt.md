> i want to write a custom functional interface which will take total 4 parameters - 3 objects and function as parameters, and return a defined Generic Object

---

Here's an example of a custom functional interface that takes three objects and a function as parameters and returns a generic object:

typescript

```typescript
@FunctionalInterface
public interface MyFunction<T, U, V, R> {
    R apply(T t, U u, V v, Function<T, U, V, R> function);
}
```

This interface defines a single method, `apply`, that takes three objects of types `T`, `U`, and `V`, as well as a function that takes these three objects as arguments and returns a result of type `R`. The method returns an object of type `R`.

To use this functional interface, you can create a lambda expression that implements the `apply` method, like this:

rust

```rust
MyFunction<String, Integer, Boolean, String> myFunction = (str, num, bool, func) -> {
    // call the function with the three objects and return the result
    return func.apply(str, num, bool);
};
```

This lambda expression takes three objects of types `String`, `Integer`, and `Boolean`, as well as a function that takes these three objects as arguments and returns a result of type `String`. It returns an object of type `String`.

You can then call the `apply` method of this functional interface, passing in the three objects and the function, like this:

rust

```rust
String result = myFunction.apply("hello", 123, true, (s, i, b) -> {
    // create a string from the three objects
    return s + i + b;
});
```

This will call the lambda expression that you passed in as the function parameter, passing in the three objects, and return the result. In this case, the result will be the string "hello123true".
