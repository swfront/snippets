> as a spring boot developer, how can i pass any subclass of a specific class to a method using generics

---

To pass any subclass of a specific class to a method using generics in Spring Boot, you can use a bounded wildcard in the method signature.

For example, let's say you have a class hierarchy like this:

java

```java
public class Animal {
   // class definition
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
   // class definition
}

public class Cat extends Animal {
   // class definition
}
```

And you have a method that takes an argument of type `List<Animal>`, but you want to be able to pass a list of any subtype of `Animal`, including `Dog` and `Cat`.

You can modify the method signature to use a bounded wildcard like this:

java

```java
public void someMethod(List<? extends Animal> animalList) {
   // method implementation
}
```

This means that the method can accept a list of any subclass of `Animal`, including `Dog` and `Cat`.

Here's an example of how you could call this method with a list of `Dog` objects:

java

```java
List<Dog> dogList = new ArrayList<>();
// add some Dog objects to the list
someMethod(dogList);
```

In this example, `dogList` is a list of `Dog` objects, which is a subtype of `Animal`. By using the bounded wildcard in the method signature, you can pass this list to the method that expects a list of any subclass of `Animal`.

> without list directly a single object

---

If you want to pass a single object of a subclass of a specific class, you can use a similar approach with a bounded wildcard in the method signature.

For example, let's say you have the same class hierarchy:

java

```java
public class Animal {
   // class definition
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
   // class definition
}

public class Cat extends Animal {
   // class definition
}
```

And you have a method that takes an argument of type `Animal`, but you want to be able to pass an object of any subtype of `Animal`, including `Dog` and `Cat`.

You can modify the method signature to use a bounded wildcard like this:

java

```java
public <T extends Animal> void someMethod(T animal) {
   // method implementation
}
```

This means that the method can accept an object of any subclass of `Animal`, including `Dog` and `Cat`.

Here's an example of how you could call this method with a `Dog` object:

java

```java
Dog dog = new Dog();
someMethod(dog);
```

In this example, `dog` is a `Dog` object, which is a subtype of `Animal`. By using the bounded wildcard in the method signature, you can pass this object to the method that expects an object of any subclass of `Animal`.
