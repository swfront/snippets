Hello! How can I assist you today?

---

> i want to write a fluent api

---

Great! Writing a fluent API (Application Programming Interface) can make your code more readable and intuitive for other developers to use. Here are some steps you can follow to create a fluent API:

1.  Define the entry point: Decide how the user of the API will start interacting with it. This is typically done by creating a class or a static method that returns an instance of the main class.
    
2.  Define the main class: This is the class that holds the majority of the functionality of the API. Each method of the class should return the class instance to enable chaining of method calls.
    
3.  Create intermediate classes: If the main class has many methods or the methods take many parameters, it may be helpful to create intermediate classes that group related functionality.
    
4.  Use meaningful method names: Method names should be descriptive and easy to understand. They should clearly convey the functionality that the method provides.
    
5.  Use method chaining: Each method should return the class instance to allow chaining of method calls. This allows the user of the API to write code that reads more like natural language.
    
6.  Use method parameters: If a method requires parameters, they should be clearly documented, and the method should have sensible defaults for any optional parameters.
    
7.  Handle errors: If a method can fail, it should return an error object or throw an exception with a meaningful error message.
    
8.  Write clear documentation: Clear documentation is essential for any API. Each method should have clear documentation that explains what the method does, what parameters it accepts, and what it returns.
    
9.  Write tests: Tests are essential for ensuring that the API works as expected. You should write unit tests for each method of the API and integration tests for the API as a whole.
    

Following these steps can help you create a fluent API that is easy to use and understand.

> can you guide step by step

---

Sure, I'd be happy to guide you step-by-step through creating a fluent API. Let's say we want to create a simple API for working with rectangles.

1.  Define the entry point:

The entry point of our API could be a static factory method on a class named `Rectangle` that returns an instance of the `RectangleBuilder` class:

java

```java
public class Rectangle {
  public static RectangleBuilder builder() {
    return new RectangleBuilder();
  }
}
```

2.  Define the main class:

The `RectangleBuilder` class will hold the majority of the functionality of our API. It will have methods for setting the width, height, and color of a rectangle, and a method for building the rectangle:

java

```java
public class RectangleBuilder {
  private int width;
  private int height;
  private String color;

  public RectangleBuilder width(int width) {
    this.width = width;
    return this;
  }

  public RectangleBuilder height(int height) {
    this.height = height;
    return this;
  }

  public RectangleBuilder color(String color) {
    this.color = color;
    return this;
  }

  public Rectangle build() {
    return new Rectangle(width, height, color);
  }
}
```

3.  Create intermediate classes:

Since our API is simple, we don't need to create any intermediate classes.

4.  Use meaningful method names:

The method names in our API are simple and easy to understand. We have `width`, `height`, and `color` for setting properties of the rectangle, and `build` for creating a new `Rectangle` object.

5.  Use method chaining:

All of our methods return the `RectangleBuilder` instance, so they can be chained together like this:

java

```java
Rectangle r = Rectangle.builder()
                      .width(10)
                      .height(20)
                      .color("blue")
                      .build();
```

6.  Use method parameters:

Our methods accept parameters that are well-documented and have sensible defaults. For example, the `color` method accepts a `String` parameter with a default value of `"white"`, like this:

java

```java
public RectangleBuilder color(String color) {
  this.color = color != null ? color : "white";
  return this;
}
```

7.  Handle errors:

In our simple API, we don't need to handle any errors.

8.  Write clear documentation:

Our API has simple and clear method names, and all of the methods are well-documented:

java

```java
/**
 * Creates a new RectangleBuilder instance.
 * @return a new RectangleBuilder instance.
 */
public static RectangleBuilder builder() { ... }

/**
 * Sets the width of the rectangle.
 * @param width the width of the rectangle.
 * @return the RectangleBuilder instance.
 */
public RectangleBuilder width(int width) { ... }

/**
 * Sets the height of the rectangle.
 * @param height the height of the rectangle.
 * @return the RectangleBuilder instance.
 */
public RectangleBuilder height(int height) { ... }

/**
 * Sets the color of the rectangle.
 * @param color the color of the rectangle.
 * @return the RectangleBuilder instance.
 */
public RectangleBuilder color(String color) { ... }

/**
 * Builds a new Rectangle instance.
 * @return a new Rectangle instance with the properties set on the RectangleBuilder.
 */
public Rectangle build() { ... }
```

9.  Write tests:

Our API is simple, so we can write a simple test for it:

java

```java
@Test
public void testRectangleBuilder() {
  Rectangle r = Rectangle.builder()
                        .width(10)
                        .height(20)
                        .color("blue")
                        .build();

  assertEquals(10, r.getWidth());
  assertEquals(20, r.getHeight());
  assertEquals("
```

> what needs to change if this is a spring boot application

---

If you're building a Spring Boot application, there are a few additional steps you can take to make your fluent API more useful and easier to integrate with the rest of your application.

1.  Define the entry point:

You can use the `@Component` annotation to make the entry point a bean that can be autowired into other parts of your Spring Boot application:

java

```java
@Component
public class RectangleBuilder {
  // ...
}
```

2.  Define the main class:

The main class can be a regular class with methods that return the class instance:

java

```java
public class Rectangle {
  private int width;
  private int height;
  private String color;

  public Rectangle width(int width) {
    this.width = width;
    return this;
  }

  public Rectangle height(int height) {
    this.height = height;
    return this;
  }

  public Rectangle color(String color) {
    this.color = color;
    return this;
  }

  public int getWidth() {
    return width;
  }

  public int getHeight() {
    return height;
  }

  public String getColor() {
    return color;
  }
}
```

3.  Create intermediate classes:

If your API requires additional functionality, you can create intermediate classes as needed.

4.  Use meaningful method names:

As before, make sure your method names are clear and descriptive.

5.  Use method chaining:

Method chaining is still an effective way to make your fluent API more readable.

6.  Use method parameters:

As before, document your method parameters and use sensible defaults.

7.  Handle errors:

Use Spring Boot's built-in error handling features, such as exceptions and response codes, to handle errors.

8.  Write clear documentation:

Use Spring Boot's built-in documentation tools, such as Swagger or Spring Rest Docs, to document your API.

9.  Write tests:

Use Spring Boot's built-in testing framework, such as JUnit or Mockito, to write tests for your API.

Overall, building a fluent API in a Spring Boot application is similar to building one in any other Java application, but with the added benefit of being able to take advantage of Spring Boot's features and tools.

> explain thisin the context of prvious answer Handle errors: If a method can fail, it should return an error object or throw an exception with a meaningful error message.

---

Sure, I'd be happy to explain how to handle errors in the context of the previous answer.

In the `RectangleBuilder` class, if a user tries to build a rectangle without setting the required width and height properties, we can throw an exception with a meaningful error message. For example:

java

```java
public class RectangleBuilder {
  private Integer width;
  private Integer height;
  private String color;

  public RectangleBuilder width(Integer width) {
    this.width = width;
    return this;
  }

  public RectangleBuilder height(Integer height) {
    this.height = height;
    return this;
  }

  public RectangleBuilder color(String color) {
    this.color = color;
    return this;
  }

  public Rectangle build() {
    if (width == null || height == null) {
      throw new IllegalStateException("Width and height must be set to build a rectangle.");
    }
    return new Rectangle(width, height, color);
  }
}
```

In this example, we are checking if the `width` and `height` properties are null, and if so, we throw an `IllegalStateException` with an error message that explains the problem.

If you want to return an error object instead of throwing an exception, you can define an error class and return an instance of that class with an error message. For example:

java

```java
public class RectangleBuilder {
  private Integer width;
  private Integer height;
  private String color;

  public RectangleBuilder width(Integer width) {
    this.width = width;
    return this;
  }

  public RectangleBuilder height(Integer height) {
    this.height = height;
    return this;
  }

  public RectangleBuilder color(String color) {
    this.color = color;
    return this;
  }

  public Result<Rectangle> build() {
    if (width == null || height == null) {
      return new Result<>("Width and height must be set to build a rectangle.", null);
    }
    return new Result<>(null, new Rectangle(width, height, color));
  }
}

public class Result<T> {
  private final String errorMessage;
  private final T result;

  public Result(String errorMessage, T result) {
    this.errorMessage = errorMessage;
    this.result = result;
  }

  public String getErrorMessage() {
    return errorMessage;
  }

  public T getResult() {
    return result;
  }

  public boolean hasError() {
    return errorMessage != null;
  }
}
```

In this example, the `build` method returns a `Result` object that contains either an error message or the resulting `Rectangle` object. The `Result` class also includes a `hasError` method that can be used to check if the result has an error or not.

Overall, how you handle errors in a fluent API depends on the requirements of your application and the preferences of your team. But it's important to provide meaningful error messages to make it easier for other developers to use your API.

---

> in previous object example how can i use the object to further proceed with flow

---

In the previous example, you can use the `Result` object to further proceed with the flow of your application. Here's an example of how you might use the `Result` object:

java

```java
RectangleBuilder builder = new RectangleBuilder();
Result<Rectangle> result = builder.width(10).height(20).color("blue").build();

if (result.hasError()) {
  System.out.println("Error: " + result.getErrorMessage());
} else {
  Rectangle rectangle = result.getResult();
  System.out.println("Rectangle created with width: " + rectangle.getWidth() + ", height: " + rectangle.getHeight() + ", and color: " + rectangle.getColor());
}
```

In this example, we first create a `RectangleBuilder` instance and use it to build a rectangle with a width of 10, height of 20, and color of blue. We then call the `build` method to get a `Result` object.

Next, we check if the `Result` has an error using the `hasError` method. If it does, we print the error message. If it doesn't, we get the resulting `Rectangle` object using the `getResult` method and print its properties.

You can use the `Result` object in a similar way in other parts of your application, depending on your specific requirements. The `hasError` and `getErrorMessage` methods can be used to handle errors, while the `getResult` method can be used to retrieve the resulting object when there are no errors.

---

> if have to use the result to determine the next step, how can contionally go forward

---

If you want to conditionally go forward based on the result of a `Result` object, you can use conditional statements such as `if` statements to determine the next step in your application. Here's an example:

java

```java
RectangleBuilder builder = new RectangleBuilder();
Result<Rectangle> result = builder.width(10).height(20).color("blue").build();

if (result.hasError()) {
  System.out.println("Error: " + result.getErrorMessage());
} else {
  Rectangle rectangle = result.getResult();

  if (rectangle.getWidth() > 15) {
    System.out.println("The width is greater than 15.");
  } else {
    System.out.println("The width is less than or equal to 15.");
  }
}
```

In this example, we first create a `RectangleBuilder` instance and use it to build a rectangle with a width of 10, height of 20, and color of blue. We then call the `build` method to get a `Result` object.

Next, we check if the `Result` has an error using the `hasError` method. If it does, we print the error message. If it doesn't, we get the resulting `Rectangle` object using the `getResult` method.

Finally, we use an `if` statement to conditionally go forward based on the width of the rectangle. If the width is greater than 15, we print a message saying so. If it's less than or equal to 15, we print a different message.

You can use similar conditional statements to determine the next step in your application based on the result of a `Result` object. The specific conditions and actions will depend on your requirements.

---

> if i have a method in the builder which succeeds the condition check like above, how can write code for that

---

If you have a method in the builder that succeeds the condition check, you can call that method to perform the check and conditionally proceed based on the result. Here's an example:

java

```java
public class RectangleBuilder {
  private Integer width;
  private Integer height;
  private String color;

  public RectangleBuilder width(Integer width) {
    this.width = width;
    return this;
  }

  public RectangleBuilder height(Integer height) {
    this.height = height;
    return this;
  }

  public RectangleBuilder color(String color) {
    this.color = color;
    return this;
  }

  public Result<Rectangle> build() {
    if (width == null || height == null) {
      return new Result<>("Width and height must be set to build a rectangle.", null);
    }

    Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(width, height, color);

    if (rectangle.isSquare()) {
      return new Result<>("The rectangle is a square.", null);
    }

    return new Result<>(null, rectangle);
  }
}

public class Rectangle {
  private int width;
  private int height;
  private String color;

  public Rectangle(int width, int height, String color) {
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
    this.color = color;
  }

  public boolean isSquare() {
    return width == height;
  }

  public int getWidth() {
    return width;
  }

  public int getHeight() {
    return height;
  }

  public String getColor() {
    return color;
  }
}
```

In this example, we've added a method to the `Rectangle` class called `isSquare`, which checks if the rectangle is a square. In the `RectangleBuilder` class, we call this method to perform the check, and conditionally proceed based on the result.

If the rectangle is a square, we return a `Result` object with an error message. If it's not a square, we return a `Result` object with the resulting `Rectangle` object.

To use the `isSquare` method and conditionally proceed based on the result, you can modify the previous example like this:

java

```java
RectangleBuilder builder = new RectangleBuilder();
Result<Rectangle> result = builder.width(10).height(10).color("blue").build();

if (result.hasError()) {
  System.out.println("Error: " + result.getErrorMessage());
} else {
  Rectangle rectangle = result.getResult();

  if (rectangle.isSquare()) {
    System.out.println("The rectangle is a square.");
  } else {
    System.out.println("The rectangle is not a square.");
  }
}
```

In this example, we call the `isSquare` method on the resulting `Rectangle` object and use an `if` statement to conditionally proceed based on the result. If the rectangle is a square, we print a message saying so. If it's not a square, we print a different message.

You can use similar conditional statements to determine the next step in your application based on the result of a method call in the builder. The specific conditions and actions will depend on your requirements.

> how can i include a predicate function, success and failure function as parameters to a method and and pass to execute the success and failure function based on the redicate

---

To include a predicate function, success and failure functions as parameters to a method and execute the success and failure functions based on the predicate, you can use the `Predicate` interface and functional interfaces for the success and failure functions. Here's an example:

java

```java
public class RectangleBuilder {
  private Integer width;
  private Integer height;
  private String color;

  public RectangleBuilder width(Integer width) {
    this.width = width;
    return this;
  }

  public RectangleBuilder height(Integer height) {
    this.height = height;
    return this;
  }

  public RectangleBuilder color(String color) {
    this.color = color;
    return this;
  }

  public void build(Predicate<Rectangle> predicate, Runnable onSuccess, Consumer<String> onFailure) {
    if (width == null || height == null) {
      onFailure.accept("Width and height must be set to build a rectangle.");
      return;
    }

    Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(width, height, color);

    if (predicate.test(rectangle)) {
      onSuccess.run();
    } else {
      onFailure.accept("The rectangle does not meet the criteria.");
    }
  }
}

public class Rectangle {
  private int width;
  private int height;
  private String color;

  public Rectangle(int width, int height, String color) {
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
    this.color = color;
  }

  public boolean isSquare() {
    return width == height;
  }

  public int getWidth() {
    return width;
  }

  public int getHeight() {
    return height;
  }

  public String getColor() {
    return color;
  }
}
```

In this example, we've added a new `build` method to the `RectangleBuilder` class that takes a predicate function for checking the rectangle, a success function for executing when the rectangle meets the criteria, and a failure function for executing when the rectangle does not meet the criteria.

Inside the `build` method, we check if the `width` and `height` properties are set, and if not, we call the `onFailure` function with an error message. If they are set, we create a new `Rectangle` object and check if it meets the criteria by calling the predicate function. If it does, we call the `onSuccess` function. If it does not, we call the `onFailure` function with an error message.

Here's an example of how you might use this new `build` method:

java

```java
RectangleBuilder builder = new RectangleBuilder();
builder.width(10).height(20).color("blue")
    .build(Rectangle::isSquare, () -> System.out.println("The rectangle is a square."), error -> System.out.println("Error: " + error));
```

In this example, we first create a `RectangleBuilder` instance and use it to set the `width`, `height`, and `color` properties. We then call the new `build` method and pass a reference to the `isSquare` method as the predicate function, a lambda expression that prints a success message as the success function, and a lambda expression that prints an error message as the failure function.

The `isSquare` method is called to check if the rectangle is a square, and if it is, the success function is executed and the message "The rectangle is a square." is printed. If it's not a square, the failure function is executed and the message "Error: The rectangle does not meet the criteria." is printed.

You can use similar functional interfaces and lambda expressions to pass success and failure functions to other methods that take a predicate as a parameter. The specific interfaces and lambda expressions will depend on your requirements.

---

> in previous example please replace runnable with a function or a supplier function

---

Sure! If you want to replace the `Runnable` parameter with a `Function` or `Supplier` parameter in the previous example, you can modify the `build` method as follows:

java

```java
public class RectangleBuilder {
  private Integer width;
  private Integer height;
  private String color;

  public RectangleBuilder width(Integer width) {
    this.width = width;
    return this;
  }

  public RectangleBuilder height(Integer height) {
    this.height = height;
    return this;
  }

  public RectangleBuilder color(String color) {
    this.color = color;
    return this;
  }

  public void build(Predicate<Rectangle> predicate, Supplier<String> onSuccess, Function<String, Void> onFailure) {
    if (width == null || height == null) {
      onFailure.apply("Width and height must be set to build a rectangle.");
      return;
    }

    Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(width, height, color);

    if (predicate.test(rectangle)) {
      String message = onSuccess.get();
      System.out.println(message);
    } else {
      String error = "The rectangle does not meet the criteria.";
      onFailure.apply(error);
    }
  }
}

public class Rectangle {
  private int width;
  private int height;
  private String color;

  public Rectangle(int width, int height, String color) {
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
    this.color = color;
  }

  public boolean isSquare() {
    return width == height;
  }

  public int getWidth() {
    return width;
  }

  public int getHeight() {
    return height;
  }

  public String getColor() {
    return color;
  }
}
```

In this modified version of the `build` method, we've replaced the `Runnable` parameter with a `Supplier<String>` parameter for the success case, and a `Function<String, Void>` parameter for the failure case.

In the success case, the `onSuccess` `Supplier` is called to get the success message, and it is then printed to the console.

In the failure case, the `onFailure` `Function` is called with an error message, and the result is ignored (since `Function` returns a result of type `Void`).

Here's an example of how you might use the modified `build` method:

java

```java
RectangleBuilder builder = new RectangleBuilder();
builder.width(10).height(20).color("blue")
    .build(Rectangle::isSquare, () -> "The rectangle is a square.", error -> System.out.println("Error: " + error));
```

In this example, we use a method reference to the `isSquare` method as the predicate, a lambda expression that returns the success message as the success `Supplier`, and a lambda expression that prints an error message as the failure `Function`.

You can use similar `Supplier` and `Function` parameters in other methods that take a predicate as a parameter. The specific interfaces and lambda expressions will depend on your requirements.

---

> can we extract the build method to a functional interface with a default method

---

Yes, we can extract the `build` method to a functional interface with a default method. Here's an example:

java

```java
import java.util.function.Predicate;
import java.util.function.Supplier;
import java.util.function.Function;

public interface Builder<T> {
    T build();

    default Result<T> validate(Predicate<T> predicate, Supplier<String> onSuccess, Function<String, String> onFailure) {
        T result = build();
        if (predicate.test(result)) {
            return new Result<>(onSuccess.get(), result);
        } else {
            return new Result<>(onFailure.apply("The object does not meet the criteria."), null);
        }
    }
}

public class RectangleBuilder implements Builder<Rectangle> {
  private Integer width;
  private Integer height;
  private String color;

  public RectangleBuilder width(Integer width) {
    this.width = width;
    return this;
  }

  public RectangleBuilder height(Integer height) {
    this.height = height;
    return this;
  }

  public RectangleBuilder color(String color) {
    this.color = color;
    return this;
  }

  @Override
  public Rectangle build() {
    return new Rectangle(width, height, color);
  }
}

public class Rectangle {
  private int width;
  private int height;
  private String color;

  public Rectangle(int width, int height, String color) {
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
    this.color = color;
  }

  public boolean isSquare() {
    return width == height;
  }

  public int getWidth() {
    return width;
  }

  public int getHeight() {
    return height;
  }

  public String getColor() {
    return color;
  }
}
```

In this example, we've defined a `Builder` interface with a `build` method and a `validate` default method that takes a `Predicate` for validation, a `Supplier` for success, and a `Function` for failure.

The `RectangleBuilder` class implements the `Builder` interface and overrides the `build` method to create a new `Rectangle` object with the specified `width`, `height`, and `color`.

To use the `validate` method to validate the `Rectangle` object, you can modify the previous example like this:

java

```java
RectangleBuilder builder = new RectangleBuilder();
builder.width(10).height(20).color("blue");

Result<Rectangle> result = builder.validate(Rectangle::isSquare, () -> "The rectangle is a square.", error -> "Error: " + error);

if (result.hasError()) {
  System.out.println(result.getErrorMessage());
} else {
  Rectangle rectangle = result.getResult();
  System.out.println("Rectangle created with width: " + rectangle.getWidth() + ", height: " + rectangle.getHeight() + ", and color: " + rectangle.getColor());
}
```

In this example, we first create a `RectangleBuilder` instance and use it to set the `width`, `height`, and `color` properties. We then call the `validate` method and pass a reference to the `isSquare` method as the predicate, a lambda expression that returns a success message as the success `Supplier`, and a lambda expression that returns an error message as the failure `Function`.

The `validate` method is called to validate the `Rectangle` object, and it returns a `Result` object. If the `Result` has an error, we print the error message. If it doesn't, we get the resulting `Rectangle` object using the `getResult` method and print its properties.

You can use similar functional interfaces and lambda expressions to validate other objects in your application. The specific interfaces and lambda expressions will depend on your requirements.

---

> no what i meant was replace the functionality in build method in the last but one response with a functional interface

---

2 / 2

I apologize for the confusion. Here's an example of how you could extract the functionality in the `build` method to a functional interface:

java

```java
import java.util.function.Function;

public interface RectangleBuilder {
    Rectangle build();

    static RectangleBuilder create() {
        return () -> {
            // Build the rectangle object
            Integer width = null; // Set the default value for width
            Integer height = null; // Set the default value for height
            String color = null; // Set the default value for color
            // ... set the values of width, height, and color using the builder methods
            return new Rectangle(width, height, color);
        };

In this modified version of the `RectangleBuilder`, we've replaced the `build` method with a default method that returns a lambda expression. The lambda expression builds a new `Rectangle` object using the builder methods.

We've also modified the `validate` method to take a `Function<Rectangle, Boolean>` predicate that takes a `Rectangle` object and returns a `boolean` value. We've also replaced the `Supplier<String>` for success with a `Function<Rectangle, String>` that takes a `Rectangle` object and returns a `String`.

Here's an example of how you might use this modified `RectangleBuilder`:

java

```java
RectangleBuilder builder = RectangleBuilder.create().width(10).height(10).color("blue");

Result<Rectangle> result = builder.validate(Rectangle::isSquare, rectangle -> "The rectangle is a square with width " + rectangle.getWidth(), error -> "Error: " + error);

if (result.hasError()) {
  System.out.println(result.getErrorMessage());
} else {
  Rectangle rectangle = result.getResult();
  System.out.println(result.getSuccessMessage());
}
```

In this example, we first create a `RectangleBuilder` instance and use it to set the `width`, `height`, and `color` properties. We then call the `validate` method and pass a reference to the `isSquare` method as the predicate, a lambda expression that returns a success message with the width of the `Rectangle`, and a lambda expression that returns an error message.

The `validate` method is called to validate the `Rectangle` object, and it returns a `Result` object. If the `Result` has an error, we print the error message. If it doesn't, we get the resulting `Rectangle` object using the `getResult` method and print the success message.

You can use similar functional interfaces and lambda expressions to validate other objects in your application. The specific interfaces and lambda expressions will depend on your requirements.

Yes, we can replace the `if` statement and `Rectangle` creation block with a functional interface. Here's an example of how you can do this:

java

```java
import java.util.function.Predicate;
import java.util.function.Supplier;
import java.util.function.Consumer;

public interface RectangleBuilder {
    Rectangle build();

    static RectangleBuilder create() {
        return () -> {
            Integer width = null; // Set the default value for width
            Integer height = null; // Set the default value for height
            String color = null; // Set the default value for color
            return new Rectangle(width, height, color);
        };
    }

    default void validate(Predicate<Rectangle> predicate, Runnable onSuccess, Consumer<String> onFailure) {
        Rectangle rectangle = build();

        if (rectangle.getWidth() == null || rectangle.getHeight() == null) {
            onFailure.accept("Width and height must be set to build a rectangle.");
        } else if (predicate.test(rectangle)) {
            onSuccess.run();
        } else {
            onFailure.accept("The rectangle does not meet the criteria.");
        }
    }
}

public class Rectangle {
  private Integer width;
  private Integer height;
  private String color;

  public Rectangle(Integer width, Integer height, String color) {
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
    this.color = color;
  }

  public boolean isSquare() {
    return width != null && height != null && width.equals(height);
  }

  public Integer getWidth() {
    return width;
  }

  public Integer getHeight() {
    return height;
  }

  public String getColor() {
    return color;
  }
}
```

In this modified version of the `RectangleBuilder`, we've replaced the `build` method with a lambda expression that builds a new `Rectangle` object using the builder methods. We've also modified the `validate` method to take a `Predicate<Rectangle>` predicate, a `Runnable` for success, and a `Consumer<String>` for failure.

The `validate` method is called to validate the `Rectangle` object, and it returns void. If the `width` or `height` property of the `Rectangle` object is null, the failure `Consumer` is called with an error message. If the `Rectangle` object meets the criteria defined by the `Predicate`, the success `Runnable` is called. If the `Rectangle` object does not meet the criteria, the failure `Consumer` is called with an error message.

Here's an example of how you might use this modified `RectangleBuilder`:

java

```java
RectangleBuilder builder = RectangleBuilder.create().width(10).height(10).color("blue");

builder.validate(Rectangle::isSquare, () -> System.out.println("The rectangle is a square."), error -> System.out.println("Error: " + error));
```

In this example, we first create a `RectangleBuilder` instance and use it to set the `width`, `height`, and `color` properties. We then call the `validate` method and pass a reference to the `isSquare` method as the predicate, a lambda expression that prints a success message, and a lambda expression that prints an error message.

The `validate` method is called to validate the `Rectangle` object, and it prints a success message if the `Rectangle` is a square or an error message if it is not.
