> imagine yourself a springboot developer and tell me how i can write a fluent api whose each step or method has a class behind it

---

As a Spring Boot developer, you can write a fluent API that has a class behind each method by following these steps:

1.  Define a base class for your fluent API that contains the common state and behavior. This class should be responsible for maintaining the state of the API as well as executing any shared logic.
    
2.  Create a separate class for each step of the API. Each class should contain the state and behavior for a specific operation or transformation.
    
3.  Define methods in the base class that instantiate the classes for each step of the API. These methods should return the class for the next step in the API chain.
    
4.  Implement the behavior for each step of the API in its corresponding class. Each class should be responsible for modifying the state of the API and executing any logic related to that step.
    
5.  Use method chaining to create a fluent API that can be easily used and understood by other developers.
    

Here's an example of how this might look in code:

kotlin

```kotlin
public class MyFluentAPI {
   private String someData;

   public MyFluentAPI withData(String data) {
       this.someData = data;
       return this;
   }

   public MyFluentAPIStepOne stepOne() {
       return new MyFluentAPIStepOne(this);
   }
}

public class MyFluentAPIStepOne {
   private MyFluentAPI parent;

   public MyFluentAPIStepOne(MyFluentAPI parent) {
       this.parent = parent;
   }

   public MyFluentAPIStepTwo stepTwo() {
       // perform some logic and update parent state
       return new MyFluentAPIStepTwo(parent);
   }
}

public class MyFluentAPIStepTwo {
   private MyFluentAPI parent;

   public MyFluentAPIStepTwo(MyFluentAPI parent) {
       this.parent = parent;
   }

   public MyFluentAPIStepThree stepThree() {
       // perform some logic and update parent state
       return new MyFluentAPIStepThree(parent);
   }
}

// ...and so on for each step of the API
```

With this approach, users of the API can chain methods together to build complex operations, while each method corresponds to a distinct class that handles the state and logic for that particular step.

> change in the above code to take a supplier function for stepTwo()

---

Sure, to modify the above code to take a supplier function for `stepTwo()`, you can change the `MyFluentAPIStepOne` class to accept a `Supplier` function that generates the next step, like this:

kotlin

```kotlin
public class MyFluentAPIStepOne {
   private MyFluentAPI parent;
   private Supplier<MyFluentAPIStepTwo> stepTwoSupplier;

   public MyFluentAPIStepOne(MyFluentAPI parent, Supplier<MyFluentAPIStepTwo> stepTwoSupplier) {
       this.parent = parent;
       this.stepTwoSupplier = stepTwoSupplier;
   }

   public MyFluentAPIStepTwo stepTwo() {
       // perform some logic and update parent state
       // then return the next step using the supplier
       return stepTwoSupplier.get();
   }
}
```

Now, when you create an instance of `MyFluentAPIStepOne`, you can pass in a `Supplier` function that generates the next step. Here's an example:

scss

```scss
MyFluentAPI fluentAPI = new MyFluentAPI()
    .withData("some data")
    .stepOne(() -> new MyFluentAPIStepOne(fluentAPI, () -> new MyFluentAPIStepTwo(fluentAPI, () -> new MyFluentAPIStepThree(fluentAPI))));
```

In this example, we're using a lambda expression to create a `Supplier` function that generates the next step of the API. The `MyFluentAPIStepOne` constructor takes this function as a parameter, and then uses it in the `stepTwo()` method to generate the `MyFluentAPIStepTwo` instance.

To pass the same `MyFluentAPI` instance to each step, we're passing the `fluentAPI` instance into each step's constructor as well.

Of course, you can define your own function to generate the next step, as long as it conforms to the `Supplier<MyFluentAPIStepTwo>` interface.

> if method stepone takes predicate and branch steptwo and stepthree based on a return type of step one, how to change the code

---

To modify the above code to make `stepOne()` take a `Predicate` and branch to `stepTwo()` or `stepThree()` based on the predicate's return value, you can update the `MyFluentAPIStepOne` class to accept the `Predicate` function in the constructor and update the `stepTwo()` and `stepThree()` methods to be created conditionally.

Here's how you could modify the code to achieve that:

csharp

```csharp
public class MyFluentAPIStepOne {
   private MyFluentAPI parent;
   private Predicate<MyFluentAPI> predicate;

   public MyFluentAPIStepOne(MyFluentAPI parent, Predicate<MyFluentAPI> predicate) {
       this.parent = parent;
       this.predicate = predicate;
   }

   public MyFluentAPIStepTwo stepTwo() {
       if (predicate.test(parent)) {
           // perform some logic and update parent state
           return new MyFluentAPIStepTwo(parent);
       } else {
           return null;
       }
   }

   public MyFluentAPIStepThree stepThree() {
       if (!predicate.test(parent)) {
           // perform some other logic and update parent state
           return new MyFluentAPIStepThree(parent);
       } else {
           return null;
       }
   }
}
```

In this updated code, we've added a `Predicate<MyFluentAPI>` field to the `MyFluentAPIStepOne` class, which is passed to the constructor when a new instance is created.

Then, in the `stepTwo()` and `stepThree()` methods, we check the result of the predicate using `predicate.test(parent)`. If the predicate returns `true`, we create a `MyFluentAPIStepTwo` instance (for `stepTwo()`) and perform some logic, otherwise we return `null`. Similarly, if the predicate returns `false`, we create a `MyFluentAPIStepThree` instance (for `stepThree()`) and perform some other logic, otherwise we return `null`.

To use this new version of the API, you could create an instance of `MyFluentAPI` and then call `withData()` and `stepOne()` with a `Predicate` that determines whether to go to `stepTwo()` or `stepThree()` based on the data. Here's an example:

scss

```scss
MyFluentAPI fluentAPI = new MyFluentAPI()
    .withData("some data")
    .stepOne(api -> api.someData != null && api.someData.length() > 5)
        .stepTwo()
    .stepThree();
```

In this example, we're checking if `someData` is not null and has a length greater than 5. If it does, we go to `stepTwo()`, otherwise we go to `stepThree()`. If you wanted to use a more complex predicate, you could define a separate method to generate the `Predicate` function and pass that in instead.
